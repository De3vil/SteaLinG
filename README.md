### New features
1- Telegram Session Hijack
* How it works ?
The recording session in Telegram is stored locally in this particular path 
`C:\Users<pc name >\AppData\Roaming\Telegram Desktop`
in the 'tedata' folder
Once you have moved this folder with all its contents on your device in the same path, then you do what will happen for it is that simple
The tool does all this, all you have to do is give it your token on the site `https://anonfiles.com/`
The first step is to go to the path where the tdata file is located, and then convert it to a zip file. Of course, if the Telegram was working, this would not happen. If there was any error, it means that the Telegram is open, so I would do the kill processes. antivirus You will see that this is malicious behavior, so I avoided this part at all by the try and except in the code
The name of the archive file is used in the name of the device of your victim, because if you have more than one, I mean, after that, you will post reques for the zipfile on the anonfiles website using the API key or the token of your account on the site. On it, you will find your token
Just that, teacher, and it is not exposed from any AV

2- Dropper
* What requirements does he need from you?
* And how does it work??
Requirements
The first thing it asks you is the `URL` of the virus or whatever you want to download to the victim's device, but keep in mind that the `URL must be direct`, meaning that it must be the end
Its Yama `.exe or .png, ` whatever is important is that it be a link that ends with a backstamp
The second thing is to take the API Kay from you, and you will answer it as well. Either you register, click on the word API, you will find it, and you will take the username and password
So how does it work?
![](src/Untitled.png)

The first thing is to create a paste on the site and make it private
Then it adds the url you gave it and then it gives you the exe file, its function is that when it works on any device it starts adding itself to Registry device in two different ways
It starts to open pastebin and inserts the special paste you created, takes the paste url, downloads its content and runs
And you can enter the url at any time and put another url. It is very normal because the dropper goes every 10 minutes. Checks the URL. If it finds it, it changes it, downloads its content, downloads it, and connects to find it. You don't do anything, and so, every 10 minutes, you can literally do it, you can access your device from anywhere
