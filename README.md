| **1-Telegram Session Hijack**      | Telegram session hijacker                                           |


* How it works ?
The recording session in Telegram is stored locally in this particular path 
`C:\Users<pc name >\AppData\Roaming\Telegram Desktop`
in the 'tedata' folder
```
C:
â””â”€â”€ Users
    â”œâ”€â”€ .AppData
    â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ Roaming
    â”‚Â Â      â””â”€â”€ TelegramDesktop
    â”‚Â Â          â””â”€â”€ tdata

```

Once you have moved this folder, along with all its contents, to your device in the same path, you will simply need to perform the required action. The tool will take care of everything, and all you need to do is provide your token on the ~https://anonfiles.com/ ~ website. The first step is to navigate to the location of the tdata file, and then convert it to a zip file. If Telegram is functioning correctly, then this error will not occur. If an error does occur, it means that Telegram is open, and you should terminate its processes. You will notice that this behavior is malicious, so I have completely avoided it by using try and except in the code. The name of the archive file is used in the name of the victim's device, because if you have multiple devices, it is possible to differentiate between them. After that, you will submit a request for the zipfile on the anonfiles website using the API key or the token of your account on the site. Your token can be found there. That's all, teacher, and it is not detected by any antivirus software.

| **2- Dropper**      | 


* What requirements does he need from you?
* And how does it work??
Requirements
The first thing it asks you is the `URL` of the virus or whatever you want to download to the victim's device, but keep in mind that the `URL must be direct`, meaning that it must be the end
Its Yama `.exe or .png, ` whatever is important is that it be a link that ends with a backstamp
The second thing is to take the API Kay from you, and you will answer it as well. Either you register, click on the word API, you will find it, and you will take the username and password
So how does it work?
![](src/Untitled.png)

The first thing is to create a paste on the site and make it private
Then it adds the url you gave it and then it gives you the exe file, its function is that when it works on any device it starts adding itself to Registry device in two different ways
It starts to open pastebin and inserts the special paste you created, takes the paste url, downloads its content and runs
And you can enter the url at any time and put another url. It is very normal because the dropper goes every 10 minutes. Checks the URL. If it finds it, it changes it, downloads its content, downloads it, and connects to find it. You don't do anything, and so, every 10 minutes, you can literally do it, you can access your device from anywhere

3- Linux support

4-You can now choose between Mega or Pastebin
