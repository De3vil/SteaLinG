### Description
The SteaLinG  is an open-source penetration testing framework designed for social engineering 
After the hack, you can upload it to the victim's device and run it
### disclaimers: 
This is only for testing purposes and can only be used where strict consent has been given. Do not use this for illegal purposes

### How can I benefit from this project?
* you can use it  ðŸ˜‚
* for developers <br>
you can read the source code and try to understand how to make a project like this
### Features
Due to the closure of **anonfiles.com** I have modified the code, and it now uploads the results to **mega.nz**

| :------------- | :-------------                                               |
| **1-Telegram Session Hijack**      | Telegram session hijacker                                           |


* How it works ?
The recording session in Telegram is stored locally in this particular path 
`C:\Users<pc name >\AppData\Roaming\Telegram Desktop`
in the 'tedata' folder
```
C:
â””â”€â”€ Users
    â”œâ”€â”€ .AppData
    â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ Roaming
    â”‚Â Â      â””â”€â”€ TelegramDesktop
    â”‚Â Â          â””â”€â”€ tdata

```

Once you have moved this folder, along with all its contents, to your device in the same path, you will simply need to perform the required action. The tool will take care of everything, and all you need to do is provide your Email and Password on the `https://mega.nz/` website. The first step is to navigate to the location of the tdata file, and then convert it to a zip file. If Telegram is functioning correctly, then this error will not occur. If an error does occur, it means that Telegram is open, and you should terminate its processes. You will notice that this behavior is malicious, so I have completely avoided it by using try and except in the code. The name of the archive file is used in the name of the victim's device, because if you have multiple devices, it is possible to differentiate between them. After that, you will submit a request for the zipfile on the `mega` website using the Email and Password  That's all, It is undetected by any AV.

| **2- Dropper**      | 


* What requirements does he need from you? 
* And how does it work?
* Requirements:
The first thing he asks for is the URL of the virus or whatever you want to download onto the victim's device. Keep in mind that the URL must be direct, meaning that it must be the end of it. Its extension should be `.exe` or `.png`, or any other important extension. The important thing is that the `link` ends with a extension `(.any extension)`.
The second thing is to obtain the `API key `from you, which you will also provide. You can register and click on the `"API"` word to find it, and then take note of the `username` and `password`.
* So, how does it work?
![](src/Untitled.png)

The first thing to do is to create a private paste on the website. After that, it adds the URL you provided and gives you the executable (`exe`) file. Its function is to add itself to the device's registry in two different ways when it runs on any device.
First, it opens the Pastebin website and inserts the special paste you created. It then takes the `paste URL`, downloads its content, and runs it. Additionally, you can enter another `URL` at any time. This is very normal because the dropper checks the URL every 10 minutes. If it finds a new URL, it downloads its content, connects to it, and continues to run. You don't have to do anything. Therefore, every 10 minutes, you can access your device from anywhere.

3- Linux support
